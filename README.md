# Get_flight
This programme can only run on mac because of the path.  
 But I'll write one for windows version.

 To download this programme, you can get access to github.com.
 You may type this command to clone the repo from github:

    git clone git@github.com:HikoPLi/Get-Flight.git

Or you may get access to the repo:

    https://github.com/HikoPLi/Get-Flight

And download the .zip file.

 If you want to run this programme successfully, you need to install python library.

# Run the programme (MacOS Version)
For MacOS users, you may run the following command in your terminal:

        pip install python

After you install this library, you can use your terminal to get into the folder and type the following command to run this porgramme:

        python main.py

# Run the programme (Windows Version)

I've already add function for changing path format of Windows, but I am trying hard to convert .py file to .exe file so that it'll more easier to run in Windows.
