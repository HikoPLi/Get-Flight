    1. Change way to import path.
        I use os.getcwd as a basic data path in checkFileExist, and inheritance the variables to every step.

    2. To solve the following error:

    {
        File "/Users/lihiko/repo/personal/PolyU/Get_flight/components/checkFileExist.py", line 22, in check_file_exist
    ifFileNotExisted.ifFileNotExisted(current_path)
    TypeError: ifFileNotExisted() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
    }
    Because I forgot to chang the current path, so the programme confused.
    I AM CARELESS!!

    3. I've added method which can allow programme run in windows path.

    After the motification, the programme run successfully.
